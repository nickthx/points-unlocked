# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-31)

**Core value:** The "wow" moment — a user sees that the points they were about to burn at 1¢ each are actually a business-class flight, with concrete numbers.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Horizontal Layers structure (user choice) — build DB → engine → UI → polish
- Init: Stack corrections from research — Neon via Vercel Marketplace (Vercel Postgres is sunset), Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` not `middleware.ts` for Clerk
- Init: Engine must be pure TS, no framework/DB imports — it becomes the v2 advisor's tool
- Init: Ranking gate — 30 Nick-verified entries covering all 8 programs before UI work leans on data
- [Phase 01]: Vercel project points-unlocked on free *.vercel.app subdomain; Git auto-deploy unconditional; DATABASE_URL sourced only via Neon Marketplace injection + vercel env pull

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Dataset verification is Nick's time on the critical path (est. 15–40 hrs across the milestone) — start data collaboration early, launch thin (30+) if needed
- Launch gate: LinkedIn in-app browser (WebView) is the highest-value session — test before the LinkedIn post
