# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-31)

**Core value:** The "wow" moment — a user sees that the points they were about to burn at 1¢ each are actually a business-class flight, with concrete numbers.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — redemption-database

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (redemption-database) — PAUSED AT CHECKPOINT
Plan: 5 of 5 (02-05 blocked on human gate)
Status: Plans 02-01..02-04 complete; 02-05 (DATA-04 verification gate) deferred by user
Last activity: 2026-09-01 -- User deferred DATA-04 human verification; phase left incomplete intentionally

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Horizontal Layers structure (user choice) — build DB → engine → UI → polish
- Init: Stack corrections from research — Neon via Vercel Marketplace (Vercel Postgres is sunset), Next.js 16 uses `proxy.ts` not `middleware.ts` for Clerk
- Init: Engine must be pure TS, no framework/DB imports — it becomes the v2 advisor's tool
- Init: Ranking gate — 30 Nick-verified entries covering all 8 programs before UI work leans on data
- [Phase 01]: Vercel project points-unlocked on free *.vercel.app subdomain; Git auto-deploy unconditional; DATABASE_URL sourced only via Neon Marketplace injection + vercel env pull
- [Phase ?]: Neon client is lazy-initialized (Proxy) so next build succeeds without DATABASE_URL at module eval; connection resolves at first query
- [Phase ?]: Homepage is force-dynamic in Phase 1 to prove the live DB path (D-16); Phase 2+ moves to cached reads

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Dataset verification is Nick's time on the critical path (est. 15–40 hrs across the milestone) — start data collaboration early, launch thin (30+) if needed
- Launch gate: LinkedIn in-app browser (WebView) is the highest-value session — test before the LinkedIn post

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Data verification | Plan 02-05 DATA-04 gate: verify ≥30 redemption entries (all 8 programs) + rule on A1–A4 assumptions + replace 2 placeholder promo rows. All 36 entries remain `verifiedAt: null`; ≥30-verified coverage test still dormant. Resume with `/gsd-execute-phase 2`. | deferred | 2026-09-01 |
