## Batch 4 — Transfer routes / A1–A4 / promos (RULED)

**Assumptions — ALL CONFIRMED by user 2026-09-01 (update [ASSUMED] markers in code/tests to verified-with-date):**
- **A1 CONFIRMED**: Marriott 3:1, 3,000-pt increment, 5K bonus per full 60K block. 59,000 → 19,000 test math holds. Note in route comments: bonus excludes AA/LifeMiles/Delta; United gets 10K/60K (neither modeled in seed routes — Alaska + ANA both get standard 5K/60K, confirmed eligible).
- **A2 CONFIRMED** as conservative simplification: 1,000-pt increments standard for Chase/Amex/Citi; Capital One allows finer — modeling 1,000 never overstates transferable amount.
- **A3 NO VETO**: Chase 1.0¢ + Amex 0.6¢ explicitly confirmed; C1 0.5¢ / Citi 1.0¢ / Bilt ~0 (0.1¢ placeholder) match standard published values. Full sign-off remains Phase 3.
- **A4 CONFIRMED**: promo bonuses multiply base-converted amount, no stacking with structural block bonuses. Live Amex→Hilton math (1,000 MR → 2,600 = 2.0 × 1.30) matches model exactly.
- **Cash-fare convention CONFIRMED**: discounted realistic retail for economy/business benchmarks; undiscounted retail for First. Goes on Phase 3 methodology page verbatim.

**Transfer routes — all 46 confirmed structurally; specific verifications:**
- Amex MR → Hilton 1:2: CONFIRMED current (update route note).
- All 7 Bilt routes survive Bilt 2.0/Cardless era: Alaska/Atmos (only issuer path), United, Hyatt, Virgin, BA, Air France, Aeroplan — all 1:1. Update file header + route notes.
- Marriott → Alaska + Marriott → ANA: 3:1 + 5K/60K confirmed eligible.

**Promo bonuses — REPLACE both placeholder rows with the single real live promo:**
```
fromProgramSlug: "amex-mr", toProgramSlug: "hilton-honors",
bonusPercent: 30, startDate: "2026-09-01", endDate: "2026-10-14",
sourceNote: "Verified 2026-09-01 — Amex MR→Hilton Honors 30% transfer bonus (effective 1:2.6 with the 1:2 base rate), live Sept 1–Oct 14 2026 per Amex/point.me/AwardWallet."
```
Delete amex-mr→virgin-atlantic 30% and citi-ty→avianca-lifemiles 25% placeholder rows. Adjust any test expecting 2 bonuses.

**Program naming:** alaska-mileage-plan display name → "Alaska Atmos Rewards" (Aug 2025 rebrand; keep slug stable).
