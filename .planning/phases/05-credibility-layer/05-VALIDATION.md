# Phase 5 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Vitest 4.1.11 (environment: node) |
| **Config file** | `vitest.config.ts` — plan 05-01 Task 1 adds `resolve.alias { "@": ./src }` (Wave 0); include stays `tests/**/*.test.ts` |
| **Quick run command** | `npx vitest run tests/<file>.test.ts` |
| **Full suite command** | `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint` (152 tests green pre-phase) |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~5 seconds unit suite; `tests/og-route.test.ts` adds ~3 s (real ImageResponse renders) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx vitest run tests/<touched-area>.test.ts` (the `<automated>` command on each task)
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint` (plus `npm run build` in 05-03 and 05-05)
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite + build green, production deploy done, inspector + waitlist evidence captured
- **Max feedback latency:** 5 seconds (unit); ~10 s when og-route is included

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 5-01-01 | 01 | 1 | PLAT-03 | T-05-02 | Fonts are pinned bytes (`wOFF` magic, exact size), no runtime fetch, no new dependency | config + asset gate | `npx vitest run tests/smoke.test.ts && head -c 4 src/assets/fonts/*.woff` + size checks | ✅ (smoke) | ⬜ pending |

## Wave 0 Requirements

Wave 0 is folded into plan 05-01 (Wave 1) and the first task of each Wave 2 plan — every test file is created in the same task as the module it covers, so no task ever runs without an automated verify:

- [ ] `vitest.config.ts` — `resolve.alias` for `@` (05-01 Task 1; RESEARCH-verified pattern)
- [ ] `src/assets/fonts/*.woff` — vendored before `tests/og-route.test.ts` can run (05-01 Task 1 → 05-03 Task 1 ordering enforced by `depends_on`)
- [ ] `tests/share-content.test.ts` — PLAT-03 helper (05-01 Task 2)
- [ ] `tests/interest-validation.test.ts` — PLAT-04 validation (05-01 Task 3)
- [ ] `tests/methodology-page.test.ts` — VAL-03 render assertions (05-02 Task 1)
- [ ] `tests/og-route.test.ts` — PLAT-03 route (05-03 Task 1)
- No framework install needed; no npm packages installed this phase.

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Share link unfurls with the branded OG image in a link-preview inspector (ROADMAP criterion 2) | PLAT-03 | Third-party crawler rendering (LinkedIn/Slack/iMessage) cannot be exercised locally; previews are Deployment-Protected so only production counts | 05-05 Task 3 steps 1–3: LinkedIn Post Inspector on `https://points-unlocked.vercel.app/?ur=90000&mr=50000` and the bare URL; Vercel deployment → Open Graph tab. Evidence: screenshot path or pasted tag list in 05-05-SUMMARY |
| Waitlist submission stores a row; repeat is idempotent; invalid input shows neutral copy | PLAT-04 | Server Actions require a browser-issued action request; the executor cannot forge one | 05-05 Task 3 step 4 (submit real email, resubmit, submit `not-an-email`); then executor runs `npx tsx scripts/db-check.ts` → `interest_signups rows: ≥1` |
| Methodology page reads correctly and is reachable from both links | VAL-03 | Wording sign-off is Nick's (PITFALLS #4 — treat as a research note) | 05-05 Task 3 step 5 |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [x] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies (checkpoint task 5-05-03 is manual by justification above)
- [x] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [x] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references (each test file is created in the task that creates its module; fonts + alias precede og-route via `depends_on`)
- [x] No watch-mode flags (`vitest run` everywhere)
- [x] Feedback latency < 5s for unit files; og-route ~3 s
- [x] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** approved 2026-09-02 (planner)
