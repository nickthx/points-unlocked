# Dependency graph
requires: []
provides:
  - Buildable Next.js 16.3.4 App Router app at repo root (Tailwind v4, TypeScript, ESLint 9 flat config)

  - Vitest smoke test (node env, no jsdom, no coverage)
  - D-14 directory skeleton: src/app, src/db, src/data, src/engine, src/components
  - .gitignore with .env* hygiene in place before any env file exists
affects: [01-02 ui-foundation, 01-03 ci, 01-05 database, 02-database, 03-engine, 04-ui]

    - Quality gates as npm scripts only — no git hooks (D-08), CI is the enforcement point
    - Tests live in tests/ and run in node environment via Vitest (D-09/D-10)

key-decisions:
  - "Scaffolded via create-next-app into scratchpad temp dir, then moved into repo root to preserve .planning/, CLAUDE.md, PROJECT-BRIEF.md, and .git"
  - "Kept scaffold-generated AGENTS.md (next dev regenerates it; committing keeps the tree clean) but dropped the scaffold's CLAUDE.md pointer to protect the repo's own CLAUDE.md"
  - "Kept vitest.config.ts as .ts per plan artifact spec; Vite emits an advisory ESM-in-CJS loader warning that does not affect exit code"

patterns-established:
  - "Directory skeleton: src/app (UI routes), src/db (Drizzle schema), src/data (curated dataset), src/engine (pure TS valuation engine), src/components"
  - "Conventional commits scoped {type}(01-01): per task"

# Phase 1 Plan 01: Foundation Scaffold Summary

**Next.js 16.3.4 App Router + Tailwind v4 scaffold at repo root with green build/lint/typecheck/test scripts, Vitest smoke test, and the D-14 directory skeleton**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-08-31T21:13:46Z
- **Completed:** 2026-08-31T21:18:59Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 27 (18 + 9 across two commits)

## Accomplishments

- Repo root is now a buildable Next.js 16.3.4 (App Router) app with Tailwind v4 CSS-first config, React 19.2.8, TypeScript 5 — planning docs untouched
- Full quality toolchain green: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (1 smoke test passed), plus `npm run format`
- D-14 skeleton in place: src/app, src/db (schema stub), src/data, src/engine, src/components
- Secrets hygiene: `.gitignore` covers `.env*` before any env file exists; `git check-ignore .env` confirms

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Scaffold Next.js 16 app into the existing repo** - `0c8275c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Quality toolchain (Vitest, typecheck, Prettier) + D-14 directory skeleton** - `48c994a` (chore)

## Files Created/Modified

- `package.json` - next 16.3.4, scripts dev/build/lint/typecheck/test/format; renamed to points-unlocked
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest node environment, tests/**/*.test.ts include, no coverage (D-11)
- `tests/smoke.test.ts` - single trivial passing test (D-10)
- `.prettierrc` - prettier-plugin-tailwindcss class sorting
- `src/db/schema.ts` - one-line stub; Drizzle schema lands in plan 01-05, Phase 2 replaces (D-16)
- `src/{data,engine,components}/.gitkeep` - empty-dir keepers for later phases
- `.gitignore`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `src/app/*` - create-next-app output (Tailwind v4 shape: no tailwind.config.js, no middleware.ts)

## Decisions Made

- Scaffolded into a scratchpad temp directory then moved contents into the repo root, since create-next-app refuses non-empty directories; scaffold's own .git, .next, and CLAUDE.md pointer were dropped
- Kept scaffold-generated `AGENTS.md` (Next 16 regenerates it on `next dev`; committing it keeps the working tree clean)
- Renamed package from "scaffold" to "points-unlocked" in package.json and package-lock.json

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None. Vitest prints an advisory warning about ESM syntax in `vitest.config.ts` loaded as CJS (future Vite `configLoader: 'native'` default); exit code is 0 and the plan mandates the `.ts` filename, so left as is.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Wave 2 can build immediately: plan 01-02 (UI foundation: fonts, @theme tokens, shadcn) and plan 01-03 (CI workflow invoking npm run lint/typecheck/test) have their prerequisites in place
- Plan 01-05 replaces `src/db/schema.ts` stub with the health_check Drizzle schema
- No blockers

## Self-Check: PASSED

- package.json, vitest.config.ts, tests/smoke.test.ts, .prettierrc, src/db/schema.ts, .gitkeep files: all exist on disk
- Commits 0c8275c and 48c994a present in git log
- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` all exit 0; `git check-ignore .env` exits 0
