**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

Roadmap Success Criteria (contract) first, then plan-frontmatter truths (deduplicated).

| #   | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 1   | Next.js 16 (App Router) app with Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui builds clean and deploys to a public Vercel URL (SC1) | ✓ VERIFIED | package.json: next 16.3.4, tailwindcss ^4 (CSS-first, no tailwind.config.js), 5 vendored shadcn components; `npm run build` exit 0 (route `ƒ /` dynamic); `curl https://points-unlocked.vercel.app/` → HTTP 200 |
| 2   | Neon Postgres (Vercel Marketplace) connected through Drizzle with env vars flowing locally AND in production (SC2) | ✓ VERIFIED | src/db/index.ts uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` + `neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!)`; `.env.development.local` exists on disk (gitignored, contents not inspected); production HTML renders the DB-success-branch text "infrastructure: live" — only reachable when the deployed server component's `db.select().from(healthCheck)` succeeds against Neon |
| 3   | Pushing to main auto-deploys; lint, typecheck, and test run green (SC3) | ✓ VERIFIED | `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml`: latest 3 runs on main all `success`; local `npm run lint`/`typecheck`/`test` all exit 0; `points-unlocked-git-main-*.vercel.app` alias exists (302, not 404 — Git-integration deploys only); prod body contains content that only exists in pushed commit 6cf759b |
| 4   | Vitest smoke test passes with no jsdom/testing-library, no coverage, no E2E tooling (D-09/D-10/D-11/D-12) | ✓ VERIFIED | vitest.config.ts: node env, `tests/**/*.test.ts`, zero coverage config; `npm test` → 1 passed (1); no playwright/cypress in package.json |
| 5   | .gitignore covers env files; no secret ever tracked | ✓ VERIFIED | `git check-ignore .env`, `.env.development.local`, `.vercel/project.json` all exit 0; `git ls-files | grep -i .env` → no matches |
| 6   | Full directory skeleton src/app, src/db, src/data, src/engine, src/components exists (D-14) | ✓ VERIFIED | All five directories present on disk |
| 7   | shadcn D-15 set (button, input, label, card, dialog) vendored — no CLI runs needed mid-Phase-4 | ✓ VERIFIED | src/components/ui/{button,input,label,card,dialog}.tsx + src/lib/utils.ts + components.json exist; tw-animate-css present, no tailwindcss-animate |
| 8   | Fraunces (opsz) + Inter via next/font wired into Tailwind v4 @theme with warm palette (D-13) | ✓ VERIFIED | layout.tsx: `Fraunces({ variable: "--font-fraunces", axes: ["opsz"] })` + Inter; globals.css `@theme` consumes `var(--font-fraunces)` and defines --color-cream/--color-ink/--color-terracotta + display type scale |
| 9   | Homepage shows wordmark + pitch + in-progress note — real app shell, no holding page (D-01/D-04) | ✓ VERIFIED | page.tsx renders "Points Unlocked", pitch, "In progress — launching soon"; production HTML contains "Points Unlocked" |
| 10  | Every page carries robots noindex until Phase 7 (D-03) | ✓ VERIFIED | layout.tsx `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` with Phase 7 removal comment; production HTML contains `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"/>` |
| 11  | CI is advisory, secret-free, no git hooks (D-05/D-06/D-08) | ✓ VERIFIED | ci.yml: 3 jobs (lint/typecheck/test), zero `secrets.` references, zero env blocks, first-party actions only; no .husky/, no husky/lint-staged in package.json |
| 12  | Full data path proven: schema.ts → drizzle-kit push → Neon → queried from a server component; health_check is the only table (D-16) | ✓ VERIFIED | schema.ts exports only `healthCheck` (`health_check` table); page.tsx queries `db.select().from(healthCheck).limit(1)` in try/catch; production renders the success branch "infrastructure: live" — the failure fallback would render "warming up" |

**Score:** 12/12 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `package.json` | next >=16.3.3, scripts dev/build/lint/typecheck/test/format | ✓ VERIFIED | next 16.3.4; all six scripts present; drizzle-orm/@neondatabase/serverless deps, drizzle-kit/tsx devDeps; no @vercel/postgres, no prisma |

| `src/app/globals.css` | @theme tokens, --font-fraunces, warm palette | ✓ VERIFIED | @theme inline (fonts) + @theme (colors/type scale); shadcn --background/--foreground carry cream/ink |
| `src/app/layout.tsx` | next/font setup + noindex metadata | ✓ VERIFIED | Fraunces(opsz)+Inter, robots index:false/follow:false |
| `src/app/page.tsx` | D-04 shell + healthCheck query | ✓ VERIFIED | force-dynamic, try/catch query, neutral fallback, no error rendering (T-01-07 holds) |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | lint/typecheck/test jobs on push+PR | ✓ VERIFIED | 3 parallel jobs, Node 22, npm cache, no secrets |
| `.vercel/project.json` | Local Vercel link (gitignored) | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists on disk, gitignored, contents not inspected |
| `.env.development.local` | Local DATABASE_URL (gitignored) | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists on disk, gitignored, contents not inspected per secret hygiene |
| `src/db/index.ts` | Drizzle client over neon-http | ✓ VERIFIED | Lazy Proxy init (documented deviation in 01-05-SUMMARY, sound: defers neon() past build-time module eval) |
| `drizzle.config.ts` | postgresql dialect, schema path, guarded loadEnvFile | ✓ VERIFIED | Matches plan exactly |
| `scripts/db-check.ts` | Round-trip proof script | ✓ VERIFIED | Exists, substantive; see anti-patterns note (CR-01, advisory) |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | ------ | ------- |
| package.json scripts | .github/workflows/ci.yml | npm run lint/typecheck/test | ✓ WIRED | ci.yml invokes exactly the three scripts; latest main runs green |
| src/app/layout.tsx | src/app/globals.css | --font-fraunces CSS variable | ✓ WIRED | layout defines the variable; globals.css @theme consumes `var(--font-fraunces)` at line 12 |
| drizzle.config.ts | .env.development.local | guarded process.loadEnvFile | ✓ WIRED | try/catch loadEnvFile present; file exists on disk |
| src/app/page.tsx | src/db/index.ts | `db.select().from(healthCheck)` in try/catch | ✓ WIRED | Import `from "@/db"`, query present, catch renders neutral string only |
| git push to main | https://points-unlocked.vercel.app | Vercel Git integration | ✓ WIRED | git-main alias exists (302, not DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND); prod serves commit-6cf759b content; Server: Vercel headers |
| Neon Marketplace | Vercel env / local env | auto-injected DATABASE_URL | ✓ WIRED | Production success-branch text proves prod DATABASE_URL works; local file pulled and present |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data Variable | Source | Produces Real Data | Status |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| src/app/page.tsx | `dbStatus` | `db.select().from(healthCheck).limit(1)` → Neon health_check table | Yes — production HTML renders "infrastructure: live" (success branch requires rows returned from Neon) | ✓ FLOWING |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

| Behavior | Command | Result | Status |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Lint green | `npm run lint` | exit 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Typecheck green | `npm run typecheck` | exit 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Test green | `npm test` | 1 passed (1), exit 0 | ✓ PASS |
| Build clean | `npm run build` | exit 0; `ƒ /` dynamic, `/_not-found` static | ✓ PASS |
| Prod URL live | `curl https://points-unlocked.vercel.app/` | HTTP 200; body has "Points Unlocked", noindex meta, "infrastructure: live" | ✓ PASS |
| CI green on main | `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 3` | 3/3 conclusion success on main | ✓ PASS |
| DB round-trip script | `npx tsx scripts/db-check.ts` | ? SKIP — not run by verifier: it inserts a row into the production DB (state-modifying); production "infrastructure: live" already proves the DB path end-to-end | ? SKIP |

### Probe Execution

No `scripts/*/tests/probe-*.sh` probes exist or are declared by any plan — not applicable for this phase.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| PLAT-01 | 01-01 through 01-05 (all five plans) | App is deployed publicly on Vercel and shareable via a single link | ✓ SATISFIED | https://points-unlocked.vercel.app returns 200 serving the built app shell; single shareable link, no auth wall |

Orphan check: REQUIREMENTS.md traceability maps only PLAT-01 to Phase 1; all five plans declare `requirements: [PLAT-01]`. No orphaned requirements.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| scripts/db-check.ts | 35 | Error handler prints `err.message`, which for @neondatabase/serverless@1.x invalid-URL errors embeds the raw connection string (CR-01 in 01-REVIEW.md) | ⚠️ Warning | Latent secret-leak in an error path of a local diagnostic script. Did not fire in any actual run (no connection string appeared in outputs). Tracked separately as advisory via the code review; does not fail a phase must-have. Should be fixed before the script is ever wired into CI. |
| src/db/schema.ts, src/app/page.tsx | 3 | "placeholder" comments | ℹ️ Info | Intentional, plan-mandated D-16/D-04 shell content with explicit Phase 2/Phase 4 replacement notes — not stubs. |

No TBD/FIXME/XXX debt markers found in any phase-modified source file. Homepage "In progress — launching soon" is the plan-specified D-04 content, not a holding page (the shell renders real DB-backed data).

Note: local main is 1 commit ahead of origin (`28797d5 docs(01): add code review report` — documentation only, no code impact on verified state; the last code commit is pushed and deployed).

### Human Verification Required

None. All three roadmap success criteria and all plan truths are programmatically observable and were verified (HTTP responses, CLI exit codes, file/wiring inspection). No `<human-check>` blocks exist in any of the five plans. Visual polish of the shell is explicitly deferred to Phase 7 (PLAT-05) per the roadmap.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. The phase goal — a deployed, production-grade skeleton — is observably true: the public URL serves the real app shell rendered by a server component that read live data from Neon through Drizzle, deployed automatically from a push to main, with green advisory CI and clean local lint/typecheck/test/build. The one advisory item (CR-01 secret-leak risk in db-check.ts error path) is tracked in 01-REVIEW.md and does not block goal achievement.
