# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation (plan 01-01)
    provides: npm scripts lint/typecheck/test that the workflow invokes
provides:
  - GitHub origin remote verified (nickthx/points-unlocked, public, main pushed, unprotected)
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml — advisory CI with three parallel jobs (lint, typecheck, test) on push + pull_request
affects: [01-04 vercel-deploy, all future phases pushing to main]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4]
  patterns:
    - "CI is advisory only: no required checks, no branch protection, no deploy gating (D-06)"
    - "Three separate jobs so the repo shows three distinct green checks (D-05 portfolio visibility)"
    - "Zero secrets/env in CI — lint/typecheck/test need none (T-01-03 mitigation)"

key-files:
  created:
    - .github/workflows/ci.yml
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Node 22 + npm cache + parallel jobs, per CONTEXT's Claude's Discretion list"
  - "Origin remote already existed (nickthx/points-unlocked, public) — verified instead of created; no branch protection present"

patterns-established:
  - "CI jobs mirror npm scripts 1:1 — adding a quality gate means adding a script, then a job"

# Phase 1 Plan 03: Advisory CI Workflow Summary

**GitHub Actions CI with three parallel secret-free jobs (lint, typecheck, test) on every push/PR against the verified public nickthx/points-unlocked origin — advisory only, nothing gates deploys**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-08-31T21:24:08Z
- **Completed:** 2026-08-31T21:25:04Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Verified origin remote: `https://github.com/nickthx/points-unlocked.git`, resolves via `gh repo view` as public `nickthx/points-unlocked`, `main` exists on the remote, and branch protection returns 404 (unprotected — push-to-main auto-deploy stays unconditional per D-06/D-07)
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: workflow "CI" triggered on `push` (all branches) and `pull_request`, three parallel jobs named `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, each using actions/checkout@v4 + actions/setup-node@v4 (Node 22, npm cache) + `npm ci` + the matching script
- Zero `secrets.` references and zero `env:` blocks in the workflow (T-01-03: nothing sensitive can appear in public CI logs); only first-party actions (T-01-SC)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Verify or create the GitHub remote** - no commit (verification only — remote already existed; git/remote configuration, no files changed)
2. **Task 2: Advisory CI workflow — lint, typecheck, test** - `85984c5` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Advisory CI: three parallel jobs (lint, typecheck, test) on push + pull_request, Node 22, npm cache, no secrets

## Decisions Made

- Node 22, npm caching, and parallel job layout chosen per the CONTEXT "Claude's Discretion" list — parallel jobs give three distinct green checks on the repo (portfolio visibility, D-05)
- No branch protection, required checks, or merge rules configured — D-06 (advisory CI) and D-07 (push straight to main) forbid them; confirmed none exist

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required (gh CLI was already authenticated; no auth gate hit).

## Deferred Steps (for orchestrator)

- **Post-push CI run verification:** The plan's final acceptance criterion ("latest CI run on GitHub concludes success for all three jobs") can only be checked after this worktree branch is merged and main is pushed to origin. Per parallel-execution rules this worktree must not push main. After merge + push, verify with:
  `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit 1` then `gh run watch <id> --exit-status` (all three jobs should conclude success — plan 01-01 verified lint/typecheck/test all exit 0 locally).

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plan 01-04 (Vercel deploy) can proceed: origin exists with main pushed, and CI adds no deploy gating that would interfere with Vercel's Git integration
- Every future push to main will produce three visible checks once the orchestrator pushes this workflow

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists on disk
- Commit `85984c5` present in git log with plan id `01-03`
- Acceptance criteria: origin URL resolves (github.com), `gh repo view` succeeds, `git ls-remote --heads origin main` shows main, branch protection API returns 404, ci.yml contains jobs lint/typecheck/test invoking `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` / `npm test`, no `secrets.` or `env:` in file, triggers on push + pull_request
- Remaining criterion (live green run) deferred to orchestrator post-push — see Deferred Steps
